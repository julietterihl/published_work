# published_work
Code I've used in published stories.

[This markdown](https://julietterihl.github.io/published_work/Homeless_Deaths_2022.html) shows the data analysis I did for a story on [deaths of people experiencing homelessness](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2023/07/26/hundreds-of-maricopa-county-homeless-population-died-in-2022/69903536007/) in the Phoenix, Arizona region. The story was published on The Arizona Republic's website on July 26, 2023, and in the print edition of the Sunday paper on August 6, 2023.

[This markdown](https://julietterihl.github.io/published_work/Homeless_Deaths_2023.html) was for a story on [homicides of unhoused people](https://theappeal.org/unhoused-people-are-being-killed-at-alarming-rates/) published by The Appeal on July 3, 2024. The bulk of the work here was cleaning the data, since it came from the medical examiner's office in three separate spreadsheets that were formatted three different ways. (You love to see it!)
