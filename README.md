# published_work
Code I've used in published stories.

[This markdown](https://julietterihl.github.io/published_work/Homeless_Deaths_2022.html) shows the data analysis I did for a [story](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2023/07/26/hundreds-of-maricopa-county-homeless-population-died-in-2022/69903536007/) on deaths of people experiencing homelessness in the Phoenix, Arizona region. The story was published on The Arizona Republic's website on July 26, 2023, and in the print edition of the Sunday paper on August 6, 2023.

[This markdown](https://julietterihl.github.io/published_work/Homeless_Deaths_2023.html) was for a story on homicides of unhoused people. It is set to be published by The Appeal.
